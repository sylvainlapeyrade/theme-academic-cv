I am a **Data Scientist** in Toronto, Canada working at [Shift Technology](https://shift-technology.com/), a company that uses AI to detect fraud in insurance claims.

I am also finishing my **PhD in Game Artificial Intelligence** from [Clermont Auvergne University](https://www.uca.fr/) in France. My research involves trying to improve **Non-Player Characters decision making in games** through logic programming and ontologies, using [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine.
