abstract: This Master thesis is the result of my research internship at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/). The goal was to study Deep Learning techniques such as Reccurent Neural Networks (RNN)for network intrusion detection. Using the widely used KD'99 network intrusion dataset, I implemented Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. I then compared my performance with other research results and tried to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on other datasets.
