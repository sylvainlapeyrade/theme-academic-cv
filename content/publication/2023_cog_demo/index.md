abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to non-player character (NPC) decision-making in games using a Prolog and ontologies declarative approach, addressing limitations of traditional techniques such as flexibility and maintainability. We implement a more complex Unity version of the Wumpus World to show our methodâ€™s effectiveness and its potential to facilitate game AI design and prototyping. Our approach can achieve the same results as the classical methods without having to hard-code all the transitions between each possible game situation.
